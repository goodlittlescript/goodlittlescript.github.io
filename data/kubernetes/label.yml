      Some resource types require their names to follow the DNS label standard as defined in RFC 1123. This means the name must:

      - contain at most 63 characters
      - contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
      - start with an alphanumeric character
      - end with an alphanumeric character
spec:
  charset:
  - alnum
  - "-"
  - "."
  case: lower
  min: 1
  max: 63
  sep: "-"
  patterns:
  - name: typical
    regexp: "[a-z0-9][a-z0-9.-]*[a-z0-9]{1,21}"
  - name: valid
    regexp: "[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9.-]*[a-z0-9])?{1,63}"
