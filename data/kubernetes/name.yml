    notes:
    - |-
      Most resource types require a name that can be used as a DNS subdomain name as defined in RFC 1123. This means the name must:

      - contain no more than 253 characters
      - contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.'
      - start with an alphanumeric character
      - end with an alphanumeric character
spec:
  charset:
  - alnum
  - "-"
  - "."
  case: lower
  min: 1
  max: 253
  sep: "-"
  patterns:
  - name: typical
    regexp: "[a-z0-9][a-z0-9.-]*[a-z0-9]{1,21}"
  - name: valid
    regexp: "[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9.-]*[a-z0-9])?{1,253}"
