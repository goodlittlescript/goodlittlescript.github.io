Data takes many forms but mostly:

- Boolean
- Number
- String
- List
- Dict
- Null

Lists and Dicts are the two main data structures. When you nest dictionaries they become a Tree, which is a special type of Graph. Notably they take the form of nested dicts, not something else.

It's usually best to think of data as strings with some structure to them, that translate into the actual data types. Everything is text.
