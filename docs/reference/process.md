A process consists of:

- Program: what runs
- Data: the information the program runs with
- Identity: who the program runs as (aka what the program can do)

Identity is what gives access to data. Data is what the program produces or consumes. In part data establishes identity, for example with an ENV variable holding a credential, and it is the program that manifests the identity.

All three are related and needed. If unaccounted for then they are implicitly present. This is just one way of viewing the world.
