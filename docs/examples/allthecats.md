# All the cats

A series of projects reimplementing the standard utility `cat`. The goal is to provide a working template for processing a bunch of files, with the essentials, including:

- Use of args, flags, help (standard library only)
- Stream handling
- Unit tests

## Implementations

- [gocat](https://github.com/goodlittlescript/gocat)
- [pycat](https://github.com/goodlittlescript/pycat)
- [rbcat](https://github.com/goodlittlescript/rbcat)
- [bashcat](https://github.com/goodlittlescript/bashcat)
