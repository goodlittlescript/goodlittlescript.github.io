A process consists of:

- Program: what runs
- Data: the information the program runs with
- Identity: who the program runs as (aka what the program can do)

Identity is what gives access to data. Data is what the program produces or consumes. All three are related and needed. If unaccounted for then they are implicitly present.

This is just one way of viewing the world.
