Building a website in multiple ways, for multiple cloud service providers, using multiple deployment pipelines. Goals are to demonstrate how to:

- Wire pipelines with identities, build, infrastructure, and deploy stages.
- Serve static assets from cloud providers.

## Implementations

- ghsite - static html to gcp, aws via github
- glsite - static html to gcp, aws via gitlab
- gcpsite - mkdocs site to gcp, protected by identity aware proxy
